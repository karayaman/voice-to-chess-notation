# voice-to-chess-notation
Program that recognizes your speech and enables you to type chess notation using your voice. This way you can play chess using your voice on the platforms which support keyboard input. To specify a piece you should say it's name, to specify a file you should say a word that starts with it and to specify a rank you should say a number that starts with it. If you say "play" program will simulate pressing enter so that the move can be played. If you say "cancel" program will simulate pressing backspace to delete last character.
